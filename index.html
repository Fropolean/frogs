          <h3>Frogs from Africa</h3>
          <img src="http://i1.wp.com/3tobeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Goliath-frog.jpg?resize=413%2C613" alt="giant toad">
          <p>
            The goliath frog (Conraua goliath) is the largest living frog on Earth.[2] Specimens can grow up to 32 cm (12.6 in) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kg (7.17 lb). This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.


            In a sample of 15 individuals,[3] weights ranged between 600 and 3,250 g (1.32 and 7.17 lb), and snout-vent lengths were between 17 and 32 cm (6.7 and 12.6 in). Their eyes can be nearly 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in diameter. The conspicuous tympanum has a diameter of about 0.5 cm (0.20 in) and is separated from the eye by about 5 cm (2.0 in) in adults. The next largest extant anurans are the cane toad, about a third smaller than the goliath in the largest specimens, and the African bullfrog, which is just over half the size of the goliath. Goliath frog eggs and tadpoles are about the same size as other frogs despite its very large adult form.

            A lateral fold extends from the eye to the posterior portion of the tympanum. Toes are fully webbed, with large interdigital membranes extending down to the toe tips. The second toe is the longest. The skin on the dorsum and on top of the limbs is granular. Dorsal coloration is green sienna, while the abdomen and ventral part of the limbs are yellow/orange. They have acute hearing but no vocal sac, and also lack nuptial pads.

          <h3>Frogs from South America</h3>
          <img src="http://www.aqua.org/~/media/Images/Animals/blue-poison-dart-frog/animals-blue-poison-frog-slide1.jpg" alt="blue poison dart frog">
          <p>
            Though they measure a couple of inches at most, the more than 100 species of brilliantly colored poison arrow frogs found in the tropical forests of Central America and South America are among the most toxic organisms in the world. Insectivorous and diurnal, poison arrow frogs come in blue, yellow, red and other colors. They have only one natural predator, a snake known scientifically as Leimadophis epinephelus that is unaffected by the potent venom found in the skin of the snake's poison arrow prey.

          <h3>Frogs from Asia</h3>
          <img src="http://gailshumway.com/gallery/plog-content/images/my-collection/frogs/asian-leaf-frog-megophrys-montana-3sharp.jpg" alt="horned frog" />
          <p>
            mphibians reach their greatest diversity in the tropics, particularly in the moist and hot environment of tropical rainforest and freshwater swamp forest.  Southeast Asia is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots for amphibians, where a remarkable evolutionary explosion has resulted in incredible diversity of form, colour and lifestyle: over 700 species occur in the region.  Frogs are to be found in the shallowest puddles, hiding under leaf litter, making their foam nests in streamside vegetation or calling incessantly from treeholes.

            Frogs reach their greatest evolutionary expression in the diverse family of Asian Tree Frogs (Rhacophoridae), which includes the spectacular 'Flying Frogs', many of which have evolved extensive webbing between their toes which allows them to glide from tree to tree. Equally remarkable are the tiny Narrow-mouthed Frogs or Chorus Frogs (Microhylidae) : these are often heard but rarely seen, as they measure just 2 cm long. Their jumping ability is quite remarkable as they can easily leap more than a metre or so i.e. more than 50 times body length !

          <h3>Frogs from North America</h3>
          <img src="http://www.grizzlyrun.com/Files/Images/Image_Gallery/northern_leopard_frog.jpg" alt="bullfrog" />
          <p>The baritone call of the bullfrog is so deep and resonant, it resembles the mooing of a cow, hence its name. Only males emit this trademark "jug-o-rum" bellow, and their choruses can be heard during the day or night.

          The largest of all North American frogs, this giant can grow to a length of 8 inches (20 centimeters) or more and weigh up to 1.5 pounds (750 grams). Even the tadpoles of this species can reach 6.75 inches (17.2 centimeters) in length.

          They are among the most wide-ranging of all North American amphibians, found in freshwater ponds, lakes, and marshes from Nova Scotia, Canada, throughout the continental United States, and as far south as Mexico and Cuba. They have even found their way to Europe, South America, and Asia.

          Bullfrogs are typically green or gray-brown with brown spots and have easily identifiable circular eardrums, or tympanum, on either side of their heads.

          Nocturnal predators, they will ambush and eat just about anything they can fit in their ample mouths, including insects, mice, fish, birds, and snakes. They sit quietly and wait for prey to pass by, then lunge with their powerful hind legs, mouths open wide.

          Males are highly territorial and will aggressively guard their land. Females are slightly larger than males.
